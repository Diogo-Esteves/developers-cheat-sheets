# Github Copilot

GitHub Copilot is powered by Codex, the new AI system created by OpenAI. It's a AI pair programmer tool.

GitHub Copilot understands significantly more context than most code assistants. So, whether it’s in a docstring, comment, function name, or the code itself, GitHub Copilot uses the context you’ve provided and synthesizes code to match.
